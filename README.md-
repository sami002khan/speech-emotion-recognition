# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition (ML Project)

This project uses the RAVDESS dataset to classify human emotions from speech using MFCC features and a CNN model.

 ## Files
- `model_training.py` – Code for data loading, preprocessing, and training
- `predict_emotion.py` – Predict emotion from a `.wav` file
- `emotion_recognition_model.h5` – Trained model
- `label_encoder.pkl` – Encoded emotion labels
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

 ##  Detected Emotions
- Neutral, Calm, Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgust, Surprised

 ##  How to Use
1. Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run training: `python model_training.py`
3. Predict: `predict_emotion("path_to_audio.wav")`

 ## Accuracy
Achieved ~88% accuracy using CNN on MFCC features.

 ## Model
1D CNN → MaxPool → Dropout → Dense → Softmax
